        <p class="w-50-l pr3-l">Similar to revelations or realizations that one has after the subconscious has been mulling over something, or seen something before you have, my works appear in a percolating manner, gently bubbling to the surface from glimpses caught here and there in iterations of drawn lines.  I remind myself to sketch slowly, and optimistically, to allow time and space for my imagination to catch on to any imagery appearing before me. And so my work is a reflection of my imagination, and often portrays some wit and humor within an emotional moment, some abstract feeling personified in a visual manner. </p>
        <p class="w-50-l pb4-l pb3 pl3-l">Working with metal lines allows me to transfer that pencil and paper sketch into a tangible object on the wall. I reference my sketch during the welding process, but I welcome the novel variances in character that appear in the metal &mdash; sometimes better than the drawing, sometimes not. Welding itself can be a grimy, hazardous process, but forming and melting metal into an entirely new object is endlessly fascinating. The final metal form of the work introduces a dichotomy in character &mdash; rather than the heaviness or rigidity often associated with metal, the sculpture seems to float on the wall, with curves, motion, fluid feeling, light and shadow, all retaining the ephemeral character of the original found image.</p>

      <div class="relative flex-l mw7 mt2-l">
        <p class="w-50-l pr3-l">I grew up on the eastern shore of Maryland, in Salisbury, with 3 brothers. I was a quiet, introverted kid who enjoyed many hours outside, reading, writing and tinkering with nuts &amp; bolts to make small figurines. Athletics and academics grew in my focus as I grew older, and college in DC was a time for me to grow socially. After college, without a specific intention for my biology degree, I returned home and returned to the childhood idea of learning how to weld in order to make metal art. I took a welding class through a nearby community college and worked for the instructor as a production welder for nearly two years. Having no formal art education, I decided to take a sculpture class at the local, Salisbury, university.</p>
        <p class="w-50-l pl3-l">Through many hours of learning and drawing and ideating, I made the leap to begin my venture as a working artist. I have been excited to see the support and response I have already received, mostly through kind words, but also through sales, awards, a feature in BLANK Magazine, a podcast interview with filmmaker David Delaney Mayer, and an upcoming curated group exhibition at LATITUDE Gallery. I am now also based out of Atlanta, Georgia, where, despite Covid, I am slowly but surely enjoying the art community I have found here. I am incredibly grateful to have wound my way to this point, to be creating in this way, and continuing to further my art.</p>
