Title: Artist Statement

Text:

Similar to revelations or realizations that one has after the subconscious has been mulling over something, or seen something before you have, my works appear in a percolating manner, gently bubbling to the surface from glimpses caught here and there in iterations of drawn lines. I remind myself to sketch slowly, and optimistically, to allow time and space for my imagination to catch on to any imagery appearing before me. And so my work is a reflection of my imagination, and often portrays some wit and humor within an emotional moment, some abstract feeling personified in a visual manner.

Working with metal lines allows me to transfer that pencil and paper sketch into a tangible object on the wall. I reference my sketch during the welding process, but I welcome the novel variances in character that appear in the metal — sometimes better than the drawing, sometimes not. Welding itself can be a grimy, hazardous process, but forming and melting metal into an entirely new object is endlessly fascinating. The final metal form of the work introduces a dichotomy in character — rather than the heaviness or rigidity often associated with metal, the sculpture seems to float on the wall, with curves, motion, fluid feeling, light and shadow, all retaining the ephemeral character of the original found image.
