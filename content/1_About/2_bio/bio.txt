Title: Bio

----

Paragraph-1: I grew up on the eastern shore of Maryland, in Salisbury, with 3 brothers. I was a quiet, introverted kid who enjoyed many hours outside, reading, writing and tinkering with nuts & bolts to make small figurines. Athletics and academics grew in my focus as I grew older, and college in DC was a time for me to grow socially. After college, without a specific intention for my biology degree, I returned home and returned to the childhood idea of learning how to weld in order to make metal art. I took a welding class through a nearby community college and worked for the instructor as a production welder for nearly two years. Having no formal art education, I decided to take a sculpture class at the local, Salisbury, university.

Paragraph-2: Through many hours of learning and drawing and ideating, I made the leap to begin my venture as a working artist. I have been excited to see the support and response I have already received, mostly through kind words, but also through sales, awards, a feature in BLANK Magazine, a podcast interview with filmmaker David Delaney Mayer, and an upcoming curated group exhibition at LATITUDE Gallery. I am now also based out of Atlanta, Georgia, where, despite Covid, I am slowly but surely enjoying the art community I have found here. I am incredibly grateful to have wound my way to this point, to be creating in this way, and continuing to further my art.
